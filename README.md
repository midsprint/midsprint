#### Sports Science Consulting

{ midsprint } Sports Science Consulting is an extension of the R package *midsprint* (github.com/aaronzpearson/midsprint). 

We help teams effectively analyze athlete tracking data to maximize their wellbeing and improve return-to-play. We accomplish this by modelling athletes' physiological responses to training and biomechanical abilities sprint mechanics. Doing so allows teams to build player profiles and incorporate these data into already existing internal structures like databases and applications.

Athlete tracking data can be used to model:
- Aerobic fitness
- VO2 max
- Anaerobic fitness
- Anaerobic capacity
- Energy expenditure and reconstitution
- Player sprint mechanics (speed and acceleration abilities)
- Preparation for competition
- Return-to-play readiness
- Elevated injury risks
